\section*{Results}

\subsection*{The first major result}

An inline figure reference will look like \tfig{single}, whereas a parenthesized figure panel
reference will be abbreviated (\fig{single}{a}). \comment{Remove `disable' from the todonotes
package arguments to display helpful inline comments like these. Additional commands can be defined
for different authors.} \lipsum[4]

\subsection*{The second major result}

Equations can be referenced such as \eqn{skaggs} and other papers as well\cite{Hill78a}. References
that only appear in the supplementary materials (figure captions, etc.) or online methods section
will follow the reference numbering of the main text and appear at the end of the main reference
list. \lipsum[5]

Important results in the supplementary data (\suppfig{template}). \lipsum[6]
