Combinatorial coding
Temporal can help
Agonists and inhibition can help
But fluctuations:
Thus, invariances may help
combine invariances with combinatorial coding 
	also explains timing
	



Olfactory systems in fly rely on combinatorics
	Many receptors, one response; one odor, many responses
		-Malnic, et al, Buck 1999, Hallem, Carlson 2006, Buck, Axel 1991 
		(OR genes), Friedrich, Korsching 1997 (zebrafish)
	Structure in the responses versus chemicals?
		
Coding capacity 
	Coding capacity in spatiotemporal sequences
		Laurent 1996 -- Dynamical repersentation of odors
		Uchida 2007 -- coding by ratios
		Reddy eLife 2018: Cao Tu Nat Comm 2017: antagonists and inhibitory
		odors can increase coding capacity
	Temporal dynamics 
		-Stopfer Laurent 2003; Raman, Stopfer 2006: Dynamics depends on odor
		identity and intensity.
		-Nagel Wilson 2011: Temporal patterns feature of receptors
		-Su, Martelli, Carlson 2011: mixtures encoded by altering response 
		dynamics, not just magnitudes. Inhibitory on top of excitatory: 
		response dynamics change in mixtures versus isolation.
	Primacy coding 
		order matters: Spors-Grinwald 2002, Junek Kludt 2010
		primacy model for simple odors

Realistic odor environments 	
	Temporal fluctuations in natural environments
	Background odors + conflicts
		
Invariances/ adaptation -- robustness and sensitivity
		-Martelli Carlson 2013: ORN dynamics are intensity-independent, but 
		each odor identity and ORN pair has different delays. Temporal filter
		is also independent of odor identity, except different odors have 
		different delays.
		-Geffen...Meister 2009
	Gain and sensitivity
		-Cafaro 2016 Cao 2016: transduction currents follow WL. Srinivas 2017:
		so do ORN firing rates and LFP. Important: for all ORN-odorant combos
		-Samuel recent paper 2017: power-law distributed binding constants
	long-term adaptation
		Guo, Smith

Downstream combinatorial?
	Divisive normalization


Invariances and adaptation as a solution to combinatorics in real environments
	
	

		
		
Do dimensionality reduction of temporal odor traces
Information is encoded in temporal invariances as adaptation variable epsilon...
